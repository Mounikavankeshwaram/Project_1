Deep Road Insights
Road traffic accidents have been highlighted by the study as a serious problem on many aspects 
of society. With the significance that roads have in the development of our society, it is timely that 
road traffic accidents be addressed. The major cause of road traffic accidents is carelessness of the 
road users as highlighted by the study. It is however important to consider the effect that the road 
design has on influencing road usersâ€™ decisions. 
The relationship between road accidents, road capacity and road geometry is one which is not 
linear. An increase in road capacity increases road traffic accidents up to some point beyond which 
they reduce due to congestion. This however applies for a road with perfect weather conditions, 
good drainage properties and it is operating within its design limits. The introduction of the 
physical conditions of road introduces another variable in understanding the relationship between 
traffic accidents and capacity. 
A road with good geometric conditions as specified in design is likely to have good traffic 
standards.
